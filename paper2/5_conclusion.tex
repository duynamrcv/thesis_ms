\section{Conclusion}\label{sec5}
In this paper, we have presented an event-based formation reconfiguration control strategy to navigate a TVF through confined environments. The proposed strategy is constructed via several behaviors based on the potential field, which is synthesized together. The \textit{EFRC} strategy is proposed, which helps the TVF to safely pass through a confined space, especially in a narrow environment. The proposed strategy includes mode switching, which allows each robot to select the mode itself based on its observation. The proposed strategy is also proven stable via the Lyapunov theorem. Results and comparison with the standard method show the effectiveness of the proposed method in guiding the TVF travel safely through confined spaces. The conducted SIL test also confirms the performance of the \textit{EFRC} strategy.
