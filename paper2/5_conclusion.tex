\section{Conclusion}\label{sec5}
In this study, we have presented an event-based reconfiguration control to navigate a time-varying robot formation through narrow spaces across various environmental settings, including forest-like and tunnel-like terrains. The proposed strategy is constructed via several behaviors, which leverage the artificial potential field, which brings t to facilitate implementation. The controller includes two modes, \textit{``formation''} and \textit{``tailgating''}, and a scaling factor that enables the TVF to adapt its shape based on observed environmental conditions. The stability of the proposed approach is also demonstrated via the Lyapunov theorem. Evaluation results show that the proposed controller effectively navigates complex environments, achieving superior control performance in most metrics compared to other established methods. Additionally, software-in-the-loop tests verify the practicality and robustness of the proposed controller in real-world scenarios.
