% \noindent\textit{\textbf{Abstract}}
% Reconfiguration control plays an important role in coordinating multi-robot systems to adapt their formations in response to narrow spaces where the risk of collisions is increased due to limited spaces. This study proposes an event-based reconfiguration control (ERC) based on an artificial potential field for navigating a time-varying robot formation (TVF) through narrow spaces with multiple environmental types, including forest-like and tunnel-like environments. The robot swarm is modeled as an undirected graph where each node represents a robot capable of collecting real-time data on the environment and the states of other robots in the formation. The information collected from each robot is used by the proposed controller, which includes two primary modes, \textit{``formation''} and \textit{``tailgating''}, to provide flexible reconfiguration between the original and the straight-line configurations. A set of behaviors is defined via an artificial potential field (APF) to achieve the requirements of goal-oriented motion, formation maintenance, tailgating, and collision-free behaviors. Several simulations, comparisons, and evaluations based on several metrics have been conducted to confirm the performance and superiority of the proposed approach to successfully navigating in narrow spaces. Software-in-the-loop tests have been conducted to verify the validity of the proposed controller for practical scenarios.

This chapter aims to extend the previous method presented in Chapter~\ref{paper1} for multiple formation configurations in response to narrow spaces where the risk of collisions is increased due to limited spaces. An event-based reconfiguration control (ERC) is presented based on an artificial potential field (APF) for navigating a time-varying robot formation (TVF) through narrow spaces with multiple environmental types, including forest-like and tunnel-like environments.
