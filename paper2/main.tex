\noindent\textit{\textbf{Abstract}}
Formation control plays a key role in coordinating multi-robot systems, especially in confined space environments where the risk of collisions is increased due to limited space. In this paper, we propose an event-based reconfiguration control (ERC) based on an artificial potential field that enhances the safety of time-varying robot formation (TVF) in a confined space. The proposed strategy includes two primary modes, \textit{``Formation''} and \textit{``Taigating''}, and provides flexible reconfiguration between original configuration and the straight-line configuration based on environmental perception. The proposed approach ensures that multi-robot systems maintain their desired configuration and collision-free trajectory. When a confined space is found to be insufficient to maintain the original formation, the configuration is either scaled down or transformed into a straight-line topology to maintain collision-free motion. A number of simulations, comparisons, and evaluations based on several metrics have been conducted to confirm the validity and superiority of the proposed approach.
