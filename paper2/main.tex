\noindent\textit{\textbf{Abstract}}
Formation control plays a crucial role in the coordination of multi-robot systems. Particularly in confined space environments, the navigation of a formation may risk potential collision due to space limitations. In this paper, we propose an event-based deformation control strategy based on the artificial potential field that enhances the safety of multi-robot time-varying formation (TVF) in a confined space. Without limited environments, the proposed approach ensures that multi-robot systems maintain their desired configuration and inter-agent collision-free. Furthermore, when the confined space is detected through the local sensor equipped in each robot that does not have enough space to maintain the original formation, the configuration is changed by scale, or transform into the straight line topology, which ensures collision-free flight. We verified the efficacy, correctness, and superiority of our proposed method through simulation and evaluation based on several metrics. The comparison is also conducted to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method.
