\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:0conclusion}
In this work, we have presented a new behavior-based controller to address the problem of UAV formation in narrow space environments. We developed several behaviors for each UAV and then proposed a function to combine them. Our approach allows the UAVs to form a V-shape formation with the capability to adjust their wings to avoid obstacles and travel through narrow passages. A number of simulation evaluations have been conducted and the results show that our control strategy is not only able to navigate the UAVs to form the desired V-shape formation but also provide them with the capability to reconfigure themselves to circumvent obstacles, avoid collisions, and traverse narrow passages in complex environments.
