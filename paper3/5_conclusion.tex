\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented an optimal model prediction-based perceptual deformation control strategy to navigate the formation of robots through narrow environments. The proposed strategy enables each robot to be able to collect point cloud data to estimate the width of environments and perform distributed decision-making to switch between modes. This approach allows the formation to adapt its shape to the available space or to transform into a straight-line formation to pass through the narrow passages. The movement requirements, constraints, and limitations of the formation are modeled using a weighted-sum cost function to generate the optimal control signal. Through the simulations and comparisons, the performance of the proposed method can be confirmed.
