\noindent\textit{\textbf{Abstract}}

Formation control plays a key role in multi-robot systems, in which a group of robots is coordinated to enhance task performance. Ensuring the safety of robot formations in clustered environments, especially in narrow space environments, remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a Model Prediction-based Perceptual Formation Reconfiguration Control (MPPFRC) strategy for a multi-robot swarm. The strategy proactively ensures the safety of robot formations moving through narrow space by changing the shape according to the environment observed from local sensors. The formation navigation method is modeled as objective functions that express the requirements, constraints, and limitations of the system in the formation movement mission. Additionally, a perceptual formation reconfiguration strategy is also proposed for distributed decision-making. Finally, simulations, comparisons, and software-in-the-loop testing results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
